This is our project for **CS163 - Data Structures**, designed to provide an interactive visualization of various data structures. Users can choose from a variety of data structures, including Singly Linked List, Hash Table, AVL Tree, and Graph. The project allows users to easily initialize, add, delete, update, and search data within these structures.

## **External Libraries**  
- **raylib**

## **Main Features**
- **Setting Options**:
  - **Background Music**: Adjust music volume.
  - **Switch Theme**: Toggle between green and red themes.
- **Highlight Code**: Real-time code highlighting as algorithms are executed.
- **Zoom In/Zoom Out**: Adjust the zoom level of the data structures.
- **Move Data Structures**: Users can drag and move data structures around the interface.
